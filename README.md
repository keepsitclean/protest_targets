# Protest Targets
Information about Republican congressional representatives and senators with narrow victory margins who might be vulnerable to pressure from protests.

## Background
Only six Republican representatives need to vote with the Democratic representatives to impeach Donald Trump. Many current congressional representatives barely won their seats and might be swayed by protests in their districts.

The situation in the Senate is more challenging but not impossible, 17 senators would need to join the Democratic senators to vote for conviction if the House votes to impeach. Again, this is not impossible, as many of these senators also had slim margins of victory in their states.

I have collected data on the Republican representatives and senators with the narrowest margins of victory in their states and districts, along with the locations of their offices. Organizing protests in the cities where they have offices, as well as other cities with high population density, could help convince them to do the right thing.
